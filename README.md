# DIGIMUSER
DIGIMUSER is a digital vocal effect processor "stompbox" that applies a variety of real-time signal processing algorithms to alter the voice of a singer. DIGIMUSER takes a (1/4)" mono jack input from a dynamic microphone and outputs through another (1/4)" cable to an amplifier or to additional audio processing equipment. Since the effects applied by DIGIMUSER are performed digitally on a microcontroller, it can be reprogrammed to implement a wide collection of effecus such as filters, delays, distortions, and spatial effects. A standard bypass stomp button enables and disables the effect, a knob selects the type of applied effect, and a slider controls the intensity of the effect.
